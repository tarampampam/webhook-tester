# WebHook Tester

This application allows you to test and debug webhooks and HTTP requests using unique, randomly generated URLs. You
can customize the response code, `Content-Type` HTTP header, response content, and even set a delay for responses.

Consider it a free and self-hosted alternative to [webhook.site](https://github.com/fredsted/webhook.site),
[requestinspector.com](https://requestinspector.com/), and similar services.

> [!TIP]
> The demo is available at [wh.tarampamp.am](https://wh.tarampamp.am/). Please note that it is quite limited, does
> not persist data, and may be unavailable at times, but feel free to give it a try.

Built with Go for high performance, this application includes a lightweight UI (written in `ReactJS`) thatâ€™s compiled
into the binary, so no additional assets are required. WebSocket support provides real-time webhook notifications in
the UI - no need for third-party solutions like `pusher.com`!

### ðŸ”¥ Features list

- Standalone operation with in-memory storage/pubsub - no third-party dependencies needed
- Fully customizable response code, headers, and body for webhooks
- Option to expose your locally running instance to the global internet (via tunneling)
- Fast, built-in UI based on `ReactJS`
- Multi-architecture Docker image based on `scratch`
- Runs as an unprivileged user in Docker
- Well-tested, documented source code
- CLI health check sub-command included
- Binary view of recorded requests in UI
- Supports JSON and human-readable logging formats
- Liveness probes (`/healthz` endpoint)
- Customizable webhook responses
- Built-in WebSocket support
- Efficient in memory and CPU usage
- Free, open-source, and scalable

### ðŸ—ƒ Storage

The app supports 3 storage drivers: **memory**, **Redis** and **fs** (configured with the `--storage-driver` flag).

- **Memory** driver: Ideal for local debugging when persistent storage isnâ€™t needed, as recorded requests are cleared
  upon app shutdown
- **Redis** driver: Retains data across app restarts, suitable for environments where data persistence is required.
  Redis is also necessary when running multiple instances behind a load balancer
- **FS** driver: Keep all the data in the local filesystem, useful when you need to store data between app restarts

### ðŸ“¢ Pub/Sub

For WebSocket notifications, two drivers are supported for the pub/sub system: **memory** and **Redis** (configured
with the `--pubsub-driver` flag).

When running multiple instances of the app, the Redis driver is required.

### ðŸš€ Tunneling

Capture webhook requests from the global internet using the `ngrok` tunnel driver. Enable it by setting the
`--tunnel-driver=ngrok` flag and providing your `ngrok` authentication token with `--ngrok-auth-token`. Once enabled,
the app automatically creates the tunnel for you â€“ no need to install or run `ngrok` manually (even using docker).

With this public URL, you can test your webhooks from external services like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and more.
You'll never miss a request!

## ðŸ§© Installation

Download the latest binary for your architecture from the [releases page][link_releases]. For example, to install
on an **amd64** system (e.g., Debian, Ubuntu):

[link_releases]:https://github.com/tarampampam/webhook-tester/releases

```shell
curl -SsL -o ./webhook-tester https://github.com/tarampampam/webhook-tester/releases/latest/download/webhook-tester-linux-amd64
chmod +x ./webhook-tester
./webhook-tester start
```

> [!TIP]
> Each release includes binaries for **linux**, **darwin** (macOS) and **windows** (`amd64` and `arm64` architectures).
> You can download the binary for your system from the [releases page][link_releases] (section `Assets`). And - yes,
> all what you need is just download and run single binary file.

Alternatively, you can use the Docker image:

| Registry                               | Image                                |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| [GitHub Container Registry][link_ghcr] | `ghcr.io/tarampampam/webhook-tester` |
| [Docker Hub][link_docker_hub] (mirror) | `tarampampam/webhook-tester`         |

> [!NOTE]
> Itâ€™s recommended to avoid using the `latest` tag, as **major** upgrades may include breaking changes.
> Instead, use specific tags in `X.Y.Z` format for version consistency.

## âš™ Usage

The easiest way to run the app is by using the Docker image:

```shell
docker run --rm -t -p "8080:8080/tcp" ghcr.io/tarampampam/webhook-tester:2
```

> [!NOTE]
> This command starts the app with the default configuration on port `8080` (the first port in the `-p` argument is
> the host port, and the second is the application port inside the container).

Next, open your browser at [`localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080) to begin testing your webhooks. To stop the app, press `Ctrl+C` in
the terminal where it's running.

For custom configuration options, refer to the CLI help below or execute the app with the `--help` flag.
